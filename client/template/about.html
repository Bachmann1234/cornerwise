<h2>What is Cornerwise?</h2>

<p>
  Cornerwise is the easiest way to find out what changes are being proposed in your neighboord. This tool was built by <a href="http://www.codeforboston.org">Code for Boston</a> using data from the Cityâ€™s Planning and Capital Projects departments. Just enter your location and pick one of the proposals on the map to find out what changes might be just around the corner.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd like to learn more or share your opinion about one of these changes, you can contact the <a href="http://www.somervillema.gov/departments/ospcd/planning-and-zoning">Planning and Zoning department</a>, or attend a meeting of the <a href="http://www.somervillema.gov/calendar?field_event_departments_value=Zoning+Board+of+Appeals">Zoning Board of Appeals</a>.
